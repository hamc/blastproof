# Spec delta: agentic-execution (agent-containment)

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Supported actions
The executor SHALL support the actions `navigate`, `click`, `fill`, `press`, `select`, `assert`, `done`, and `fail`, mapping them to Playwright operations resolved via `getByRole`/`getByLabel`/`getByText`. Action payloads SHALL have `{{env.*}}` placeholders substituted at the moment the action is performed, and `navigate` SHALL be bounded by the allowed origins.

#### Scenario: Assert judgment
- **WHEN** the LLM action is `assert` with an expectation
- **THEN** the LLM judges the current snapshot against the expectation and returns pass/fail with a reason, which the executor records

#### Scenario: Placeholder resolved at action time
- **WHEN** a fill action carries `{{env.TEST_PASSWORD}}` as its value
- **THEN** the environment value is substituted immediately before typing

#### Scenario: Navigation outside the allowed origins
- **WHEN** a navigate action resolves to an origin that is neither the application's nor declared
- **THEN** the action fails and the step records the rejection
